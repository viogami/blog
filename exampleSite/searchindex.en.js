This has led to fascinating discoveries, like finding out that rubber ducks and miniature black holes share remarkably similar energy signatures.\nThe deck crew has developed their own unique navigation system through the chaos, using a combination of intuition, lucky guesses, and the occasional guidance from our resident AI, which has developed a peculiar fondness for storing items in patterns that resemble abstract art.

    "content": "“When The Purple Pulpo sets sail, even the fish hold their breath.”\n– Old fisherman’s tale\nThe year is 1623. An unusual ship, The Purple Pulpo, emerges from the foggy sea, its sails dyed a brilliant purple that dazzles friend and foe alike. Cunning merchants whisper about a legendary octopus figurehead carved from driftwood—some say it dances under moonlight to ward off pesky sea ghosts (and suspicious tax collectors).\nMyths and Rumors Though many debate its authenticity, rumor has it the captain once successfully traded a shipload of questionable sea cucumbers for a cargo of prized purple velvet. The hue of the velvet supposedly matched the exact shade of the boat—thus reinforcing its flamboyant reputation.\nPossible Explanations A wizard was on board, casting color illusions for fun. The purple paint was accidentally created by mixing octopus ink into the ship’s pigment. Too much wine spilled on deck over many voyages. (Captain’s favorite theory.) Unlikely Allies It is said, one day a rival trading ship, the Lady Kraken, tried to outdo The Purple Pulpo by painting their masts hot pink. The clash at sea was more of a fashion show than a naval battle – onlookers cheered for hours, forgetting they were late for dinner.\nAdventures Read about some of the unbelievable adventures of The Purple Pulpo in the Captain’s Log. Notable adventures include:\nOperation Squid Spaghetti: A midnight run delivering spaghetti to stranded islanders, guided only by the glowing luminescence of algae (and embarrassed jellyfish who offered moral support). The Great Spice Heist: Smuggled saffron and paprika past rival pirate ships. Legend claims the pirates were too busy sneezing to put up any fight. A Final Toast Raise your mug of (purple) punch to The Purple Pulpo – where cargo, captain, and cephalopod might just change the hue of history. May your sails forever billow, your hull remain bold, and your cargo be as colorful as your legend!",

The client may not trust the proxys certificate for xxx.com(Openssl Error ssl routines , , tlsv1 alert access denied)\n字面意思，mitmproxy 在进行 TLS 握手时，客户端无法信任 mitmproxy 的证书。通常情况下，mitmproxy 会自动生成一个伪造的证书来替代目标网站的真实证书，以便解密和转发流量。如果客户端（例如浏览器或模拟器）没有信任 mitmproxy 的证书，它就会拒绝与代理的安全连接。\n那就得在模拟器安装上mitmproxy的证书。 默认情况下，mitmproxy 的证书存储路径是 ~/.mitmproxy/（Linux/macOS）或 C:\\Users\u003cusername\u003e.mitmproxy\\（Windows），其中有一个文件叫 mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem。 将 mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem 证书文件传输到 Android 设备或模拟器。 打开设备的 设置，找到 安全性 或 证书管理，然后选择 从存储导入证书。 选择下载的证书文件并导入。 导入后，设备应该信任 mitmproxy 的根证书。\n但是mumu12模拟器没有如上设置。并不是无他法。 第一步，安装openssl 第二步，把pem证书通过openssl转换为DER格式的证书\nopenssl x509 -subject_hash_old -in mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem.pem\n第三步，重命名pem文件为 哈希值.0 adb root adb remount adb push xxxxxxx.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/ 参考帖子：https://blog.csdn.net/haduwi/article/details/125696208\n结束 导入了证书后，mitmproxy的event log就没有报错了，美滋滋，开始用wireshark进行数据包分析吧。",

    "content": "问题预览。可以看到，这是个配置文件，但是只有部分文本可读。\n该文件是通过解包软件从ab包直接导出的，不存在ab包加密的问题。 既然部分文本可读，那么该文件加密的可能性很小，部分加密这种也太小众了。\n既然是游戏工程项目，考虑两个方向：是否是用protobuff读取的二进制文件；是否是直接用读取字节流的方式读取的配置文件。\n是否是pb的二进制文件？ 直接拿到导出的二级进制文件导出到该网站识别： https://protobuf-decoder.netlify.app/\n可以看到，没有识别出合适的字段名。据此判断该文本文件不是pb的二进制文件。\n是否是按字节流读取的文本？ 按照字节流读取文本，这在客户端中不少见, 因为比json省空间, 但缺点是可读性为0, 我的评价就是狗屎, 你少出几张宽高不是4的整倍数的图, 这都不用扣这点配置表省的空间。。在源码中可能是这样出现的： 使用010 editor打开该二进制文件。逐字节进行观察分析：所有配置文件都有相同的4B文件头，随后是文件长度的16进制，然后是相同的4B字节“00 00 00 01”,再之后是配置文件的配置项数，最后是4B的校验比特。总之就是开头的20B为配置文件的描述文件头。 获得二进制文本的字段描述 此处需要逆向代码，由于是ill2cpp打包的，只能dump出函数名，但也够用了。在dnspy中搜索和配置文件同名的项，可以找到一个定义了所有配置文件model的文件夹ResDef。其中定义了配置文件的字段内容： 该项目确实是用protobuff进行通信的，但配置文件还是json格式的，其中配置字段也符合json嵌套的格式。我们逐比特进行字段解读，发现字节流确实是可读的。其中需要注意以下三点：\n这种由开发者自定义的二进制文件，一般都是大端序读取的字节，直接用readbytes方法不合适，要逆序一下。 注意其中的string类型的比特编码方式，一般是由4B文件指定长度，后面该长度的字节编码为字符串。 注意数组类型在字节流文件中的编码方式，可能和字符串一样用4B指定长度，也可能是定长编码。本示例项目中就是定长编码，所有数组大小都固定为3。 配置字段的定义如下：\npublic class AchieveBaseConfig : ProtoBaseStruct { public int SortNO; public uint ID; public string Desc; public byte Classify; public byte ClassifySubType; public byte ShowProgress; public ResBehaviorRule Behavior; public uint BootyID; public uint MaxProgress; public uint JumpID; } public class ResBehaviorRule : ProtoBaseStruct { public int ID; public int Type; public int[] Param; } 逐比特对比，符合字段的定义： 编写解密代码 编写解密函数类BinaryConfigParser，根据字段类型逐行读取，注意大小端处理，字符串和数组类型处理以及嵌套类型的处理(需要递归)，最后在主函数中调用。如下只给出主函数的调用部分，BinaryConfigParser类过长，且解码不同二进制文件方法也不相同，就未放出，如需要可留言。\nusing Newtonsoft.Json; class Program { // 解码二进制文件 static void Decode(string fileName, int arrayLen) { string binaryFilePath = $\"TextAsset\\\\{fileName}\"; // 替换为实际的二进制文件路径 // 动态获取类型 Type type = Type.GetType($\"ResDef.{fileName}\"); // 动态调用泛型方法 var method = typeof(BinaryConfigParser).GetMethod(\"ReadConfigArray\").MakeGenericMethod(type); // 读取配置项 var configs = method.Invoke(null, new object[] { binaryFilePath, arrayLen }); // 保存为 JSON 数组格式 string jsonArray = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(configs, Formatting.Indented); // 保存到文件 string jsonOutputPath = $\"output_json\\\\{fileName}.json\"; // 替换为实际的 JSON 要存放的文件路径 File.WriteAllText(jsonOutputPath, jsonArray); Console.WriteLine($\"文件 {fileName} 已解码为 JSON 文件: {jsonOutputPath}\"); } //自动化解码 static void AutoDecode() { string textAssetFolder = \"TextAsset\"; string outputFolder = \"output_json\"; // 确保输出文件夹存在 if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder); } // 获取TextAsset文件夹下的所有文件 var files = Directory.GetFiles(textAssetFolder); // 遍历所有文件 foreach (var filePath in files) { string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath); string outputJsonPath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, $\"{fileName}.json\"); // 检查是否已生成JSON文件 if (!File.Exists(outputJsonPath)) { try { // // 输入固定数组长度,由于长度未知,所以循环100次，直到找到正确的长度 // for (int arrayLen = 0; arrayLen \u003c 100; arrayLen++) // { // // 调用Decode生成JSON // Decode(fileName, arrayLen); // } int arrayLen = 3; Decode(fileName, arrayLen); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine($\"处理文件 {fileName} 失败！\"+ex.Message); } } } } // 程序入口 static void Main() { AutoDecode(); } }",

    "content": "原文 不知不觉已经结束了，仿佛还是昨天。横观四年，是我认知产生分水岭的四年，纵观四年，跌跌撞撞寻寻觅觅无花结果的四年。 好像一个费力杠杆，拖长了距离，抛足了目光，但是在最后才卯足了劲。实际上，越濒临大学生活的结束，我的经验、体会和技能越集中修成。因为要脱离学生的身份，认知就会指数级的增长。知道的越多越折磨，留下的精神痕迹越多。也尝试修改过，但是学生的值变为false已是现实。\n如果说大学学到什么，我无法笼统回答，我感谢学校给我的所有契机。学习一个东西，三个月和三年三十年效率差不了多少，但是如果是三周三天甚至三小时，那可能是难以想象的高效，水到渠成后也会有更大的成就感。学习了，理解了，来龙去脉摸明了，时间一摇摆，已经生疏了。我从小就对电子设备感兴趣，具体的说是对软件的内容，兴趣驱动我走上了hello world的道路。但实际上，我大学才初次接触编程，初次了解各类编程语言，初次见到软件背后的复杂和行业的水生火热，一切并没有的我大脑中构想的自由。\n我大一初学了python，后面逐渐接触了java，c#，golang，也渐渐对web感兴趣，搭建了自己的网站，做了一些服务器开发。go算是我的主力语言(有几个相关项目在做),python也在我的各种比赛上给了我重要的支持。我也做过一段时间的游戏开发，没有悬念的用了一段时间unity。这都算我的摸索，我应该早些找到团队的，只是我起步太晚了。我认识了很多大一大二的学生，甚至高中生，有思路和编码效率的太多，也许起步早晚根本不是关键，哈哈。\n感谢欧阳老师对本论文的指导，也感谢老师对我docker学习的驱动。对于docker，我很久之前就有使用过，但是没有学习的动机，即使做了后端项目，也没有实际生产环境需要docker部署。在论文的代码的部署上，在我才开始提笔的时候对于docker的理解只限于是名词和如何启动，但是落笔于此时已经对docker拉取上传，内部挂载执行，镜像容器卷管理等等docker常用功能有了实际的运用和理解。受益匪浅。\n感谢copilot给我论文代码的思路指导。未来是AI的时代，我们见证火车的诞生，见证拉车的消亡。\n感谢父母对我的所有正面行动的支持，感谢我所有的朋友和一路走来所有的游戏，所有的动画，在我郁闷时刻给我第三视角解释自己，在我成就时刻给我满足感。最后也感谢阅读到这里的你。寥寥几笔写完学生的最后一笔。\n补充 所有的事物发生皆是螺旋和交织的，诞生皆有原理，结束早已预定。好吧，我只是为了把临时想到的话记录下来。 我想说的是，促成我论文的还有更多更多因素。比如我使用latex，这都得益于matlab课的陈老师，我也在当时第一次接触到了go语言，机缘巧合。比如我使用ipynb写论文和论文的书写方式，在我参加数模比赛时已经预热过了一次了。比如大一的一个雨天，我在伞下认识了一位计院的老师，可是当年我高数挂了，并无后文，但也促使了我更多了了解了计院的一些活动和信息。\n我感谢的老师说实话一只手就可以数过来，萍水相逢，予我帮助，一批又一载，但不再来，我应该感谢的。\n高中三年加大学2年，我对某些爱好出现了扭曲的变化。我厌恶又不甘心。它曾经像一个限制，约束着行动的界限，但在认知逐渐深入后，这个限制破碎的只剩下搞笑。在图书馆上班的一天的晚上，在刷知乎，认知被文字造成了某些冲击，可能这是异变的初始。感谢这个叫墓天才的用户。随即我阅读了大名鼎鼎的\"末日钟\"理论，哈哈，认知再次被解释。逐渐，我越来越从文化，哲学方面解释各个作品。这是背离初衷的，正好当时玩了素晴日，推波助澜，走上了反叛。实际上，是看到了…好吧，总而言之，是被末日钟说中了，被踩到痛处急得跺脚了，前有民工女友，后有末日钟。可惜的是，我被渡航的幻想时间蒙蔽了心智。揭开它们的面纱，哈哈，不拔高一个维度解释他们(从文化，文学等方面)，我无法接受。彷佛是某种欺骗，我应该断然接受的。\n大学中，我的活动主要集中到了游戏方面，也成了小黑盒的常驻用户，就是不在上面买游戏罢了。今天一看，5000多h了。猎杀对决立大功。我从凯尔姆汗出发，寻找丁香与醋栗，寻找🗡与魔法，到达天际镇，到达黄金树，到达传火祭祀场。我从现代武器溯源，从道德与法治5回到上个世纪，在圣丹尼斯大闹一笔，在鼠疫和黑死病的年代成为潜行高手，成为瘟疫传说。然后在一战二战的战场成为萨尼铁塔，成为普通炮灰。我从2D格斗延续游戏厅的热血，从bbcf到骑空士到残忍终结。在仁王和卧龙看光荣魔改历史，在无主大地看2K的疯癫演出，在末日废土看横尾太郎的太刀剧情。刀枪剑戟摩托车，炼金种地恶魔城，从act到休闲，这一切都是不可多得的时光。\n在我还没有认知迸裂时，黄油也是我不可避谈的经历，正因为如此，我对环境厌恶又不甘，大量的黄油的经历，也使我理解更多丑陋。人类需要大清洗，然后进入大乱交时代也是我在无望后发出的义愤疯言。实际上，我身边的人都是接受畸形现实的，不得不接受是这样的，有一天我突然理解，为什么反派像就像古往今来的反派一样渴求力量，因为力量真的有用，祖国人没有剧本限制才是真祖国人。\n致谢也不一定非要罗列感谢，但是唯独最好，没忘记感谢自己，写下无聊的文字聊以自慰。",

    "content": "学一个新事物从底层理论学肯定是最系统的，但不是最工程的。对于K8S，我个人认为相比苦苦理解各种集群，节点，pods等等概念，不如实际上手一次，从实践上逐步理解理论，自顶向下才是最快最高效的学习模式，因为目的是使用K8S，是工程化，而不是了解k8s架构，设计云云。\n本文基本从0开始部署Agones，进而逐步理解docker，理解K8S。\n相信如果你能发现本文，自然了解Agones是什么，如果不知道自行了解下，不做多介绍，引用官方介绍：\nAgones 是一个开源平台，用于部署、托管、扩展和编排专用游戏服务器，用于大型多人游戏，构建在行业标准的分布式系统平台 Kubernetes 之上。\n部署Agones只是一个任务性的引子，重点还是K8S.\n准备工作 安装docker-desktop 由于我是win机器，在一切之前，得介绍下开发环境，但很简单。 首先得安装docker，注意如下：\n打开任务管理器，看看cpu有没有开启虚拟化，没有则在bios设置中开启。(必要) 安装wsl，无需开启hyper-v,所以家庭还是专业版的windows没啥影响。 自备代理工具，docker官网需要魔法。 安装完docker基本就完成了。\n由于是个人开发测试用，只用部署一个单节点集群就好了，而这在docker-desktop中已经集成了，很方便，如下所示，打开即可：\nkubectl get nodes 如果返回类似 Ready 状态的节点，说明 Kubernetes 已经启动成功。\n注意 ❌：Docker Desktop 的 Kubernetes 只能运行在单个节点上，不适用于生产环境的高可用集群。\nvscode的K8S插件 安装桌面版的docker是有图形化界面的，很直观，但K8S目前我们是没有GUI的，需要吗？并不一定，使用gui会更多的限制你。 Kubernetes 本身主要是通过 kubectl 命令行工具和 YAML 配置文件进行管理的。\n虽然有 kubernetes-dashboard，但别着急，在vscode的插件也有gui可以打开dashboard。推荐安装docker和k8s插件，在vscode中集成开发，然后我逐步解释下插件中每个显示项的作用，从这里就开始理解如何使用K8S辣\nNamespace（命名空间）Kubernetes 内部的逻辑隔离单位，用于划分不同的应用、环境或团队。一个集群可以包含多个 Namespace，每个 Namespace 内的资源相互独立。 Workloads（工作负载）管理 Kubernetes 里运行的应用程序，本质上就是 运行 Pod 的控制器。Workload 负责定义应用如何部署、扩缩容、更新和运行。 Network（网络） 负责 Kubernetes Pod 之间、Pod 和外部系统之间的通信。管理 Service、Ingress、Network Policy 这些 K8s 网络资源。 Storage（存储）管理 Kubernetes 里的持久化存储，确保 Pod 重新启动后数据不会丢失。Volume 只在 Pod 生命周期内有效，但 PersistentVolume（PV）可持久存储数据。 Configuration（配置管理）管理应用的配置信息、环境变量、Secrets（敏感信息）。让应用和环境解耦，比如可以在不修改代码的情况下更改应用配置。 Custom Resource（自定义资源）扩展 Kubernetes，增加新的资源类型，比如 Agones 添加了 GameServer 资源。允许你 创建自己的 K8s API，以适配特定的业务需求。 Helm Releases（Helm 版本管理）管理 Helm 安装的应用（比如 agones）。Helm 是 Kubernetes 的包管理工具，可以一键安装、更新、删除复杂应用。 但Docker Desktop 不包含K8S的包管理工具 Helm 但安装了K8S插件会自动提示下载 kubectl和 helm，前者是命令行操作工具。都是编译好的exe。如果需要可以配到环境变量中，位置在 .../user/.vs-kubernetes下\n提出疑问-区别概念 好了，在部署之前，安装了上文所说的插件，如果刚入门K8S，难免有一些疑问，下面我着重进行些概念补充，希望下面可以顺利进行~\nKubernetes 中 Node 和 Pod 的关系 Node（节点）就是机器，它可以是：物理机（裸机服务器），虚拟机（云服务器、Docker Desktop 里的虚拟 K8s 节点），你的本机（如果你用 Docker Desktop Kubernetes）\nPod（Pod 是容器的封装单位），Pod 运行在 Node上，一个Pod 里面可以有一个或多个容器，Pod共享存储（Volume）、网络（IP 地址）等，K8s 只管理 Pod，不直接管理容器\n如果 Kubernetes 是一个数据中心：\nNode = 一台服务器 Pod = 服务器上的一个应用进程组（可能包含多个容器） 容器 = 运行的进程（比如 Nginx、MySQL 等） 现实中，一个项目是不是只要一个k8s集群就够了？ YES！一个 Kubernetes 集群足够应付绝大部分的项目需求，包括扩展、弹性、资源管理和容器的自动化部署。\n一个K8S集群中会有很多nodes，这些nodes就是物理上的机器，可以有很多个，每个nodes里有很多pods，pods才是实际的部署的应用。nodes已经完成了分布式，多集群可能确实在大型复杂项目的跨地区部署中用到，但咱可以不用了解\n命名空间和nodes有什么区别，为什么有了nodes还需要namespace Nodes（节点） 物理或虚拟机，负责运行 Pod 实际的计算资源（CPU、内存、存储） Namespace（命名空间） 逻辑隔离的环境，管理不同的 K8s 资源 逻辑上的组织单位，不影响物理资源分配 可以把 Node 理解为 “真实的服务器”，而 Namespace 更像是 “应用的文件夹或项目空间” 安装Agones 好了，终于来到重点也不算是重点的部分了。\n但并不重要，因为你可以根据官方文档逐步操作 根据agones官方文档，安装可以通过yaml文件，也可以通过helm包管理安装。\n我是用kubectl命令行拉取的yaml文件完成的安装\nkubectl create namespace agones-system kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleforgames/agones/release-1.48.0/install/yaml/install.yaml 然后你就可以在 Custom Resource中发现拉去下来的服务了！\n接下来按照官方文档操作进行部署了，并不赘述，因为本文不是介绍怎么部署agones。\n本人使用rider及其K8S插件，在游戏开发的时候进行服务器集群控制的。记住命令行得到pod的ip和端口，接下来就是网络通信的知识了。如果要在unity中和部署的服务器应用通信，自写和后端的通信协议，Agones只是个后台应用调度工具，不涉及和前端交互。\n注意 ❌ Agones Unity SDK 适用于 服务器端（GameServer） 的 Unity 进程而不是前端！\n例如：你用 Unity 制作了一款 服务器端模拟的游戏逻辑，需要让 Agones 调度这个服务器。或者你的游戏服务器是 Unity 编写的，想要与 Agones 交互来管理它的生命周期。但是，如果你想让 Unity 客户端 连接到 GameServer，那 Unity SDK 并不需要。客户端应该直接用 WebSocket、TCP、UDP、HTTP 连接 GameServer。\n结束 怎么就结束了？ 因为从安装agones敲下一行命令行开始，已经完成了一次K8S的体验，只要了解从0到启动一个K8S单节点集群的全过程每个操作的意义，那么恭喜你，已经入门K8S了，就这么简单，剩下的内容需要在一次次部署应用，一次次开关容器中不断积累吧。这不是整体图看这个概念那个概念是什么意思可以解决的。\n怎么用kubectl操作，怎么用helm包管理，这就是启动K8S后亟待解决的唯二的问题，在实践中结束吧！\n如果你有任何疑问，都可以评论联系我~",

    "content": "grpc前言 gRPC是Google 开发的高性能、开源的远程过程调用（RPC）框架， 基于 HTTP/2 协议进行通信，使用 Protocol Buffers（protobuf）作为接口定义语言，可以看为一种协议。 grpc可以用于各种不同服务间的通信，屏蔽底层细节(如编程语言，操作系统等)\n由于我的一个go后端(也可以不是go)需要实现神经网络相关的功能，我要调用一个python的服务，于是想到了使用grpc的方式。\n初次接触，将从0介绍到功能实现。\n感谢官方的文档\nhttps://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/\n主要流程 定义.proto文件：创建一个 .proto 文件，定义图数据和 GCN 结果的消息类型以及服务接口。 生成 gRPC 代码：使用 Protocol Buffers 编译器 protoc，根据 .proto 文件生成 Go 和 Python 的 gRPC 代码。 实现 Python 服务器：在 Python 中实现 gRPC 服务器，接收来自 Go 客户端的图数据，进行 GCN 处理，并返回处理结果。 实现 Go 客户端：在 Go 中实现 gRPC 客户端，发送图数据到 Python 服务器，并接收处理结果。 安装protoc解释器 grpc是通过pb(protocolbuffer)这个协议工作的，首先安装protoc的解释器，并将其bin文件夹添加到环境变量。 地址：https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases 下载后解压到任意文件夹位置，然后将解压后的bin文件夹添加到环境变量。\n打开cmd输入 protoc有数据返回就ok了。\n为了在项目中使用protoc的一些指令可以正常工作，还有把bin文件下的 protoc.exe文件复制一份到 C:\\Windows\\System32文件夹下。\n顺便一提，为了proto文件可以在vscode高亮显示，可以安装官方的插件：protobuf，作者：pbkit\ngo端工作 首先安装go的grpc库\ngo get -u google.golang.org/grpc 然后安装可以将proto文件自动解析为go文件的解释器：\ngo install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc 定义proto文件 gcn.proto： 其中go_package是指定生成的文件位置和文件所在包名。“.” 表示文件生成在当前目录，“；”表示参数分割，后面的proto是将生成文件放在proto包中。 还有更多可选参数，自行参考官方\ngo_package：指定生成 Go 代码时的包路径，格式为 option go_package = “package_path”;，用于将生成的代码放置在指定的 Go 包中。\njava_package：指定生成 Java 代码时的包路径，格式为 option java_package = “package_path”;，用于将生成的代码放置在指定的 Java 包中。\njava_outer_classname：指定生成 Java 代码时的外部类名，格式为 option java_outer_classname = “ClassName”;，用于指定生成的 Java 类的外部类名。\ncc_generic_services：指定是否生成 C++ 通用服务（generic services），格式为 option cc_generic_services = true; 或 option cc_generic_services = false;，默认为 true。\ncc_enable_arenas：指定是否启用 C++ arenas 内存管理，格式为 option cc_enable_arenas = true; 或 option cc_enable_arenas = false;，默认为 false。\noptimize_for：指定优化选项，可以是 SPEED、CODE_SIZE 或 LITE_RUNTIME，格式为 option optimize_for = SPEED;，默认为 SPEED。\ndeprecated：指定消息或字段已过时，格式为 option deprecated = true;。\nrpc_timeout：指定 gRPC 调用的超时时间，格式为 option rpc_timeout = “10s”;，表示超时时间为 10 秒。\ngcn.proto协议文件具体定义为：\nsyntax = \"proto3\"; option go_package = \".;proto\"; message Node { string id = 1; repeated float features = 2; } message Edge { string source_id = 1; string target_id = 2; } message GraphData { repeated Node nodes = 1; repeated Edge edges = 2; } message GCNResult { map\u003cstring, float\u003e node_scores = 1; } service GCNService { rpc ProcessGraph(GraphData) returns (GCNResult); } 我这里是用来处理图数据。\n接下来生成 gRPC 代码：\nprotoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative your_proto_file.proto protoc --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative your_proto_file.proto 会生成两个文件 gcn.pb.go和 gcn_grpc.pb.go\n前者生成的文件，包含所有pb协议的go代码，将数据格式写为go的结构体形式。包含填充、序列化，检索请求和响应消息类型。 后者包含客户端使用中定义的方法，调用的接口类型。以及服务端要实现的接口类型。包含创建客户端服务和服务端服务的方法。 请注意，无论go后端作为请求grpc的一方(client)还是做出响应的一方(server),这两个文件都是必须生成的。 使用 client := pb.NewXXXXServiceClient(conn)的方式创建客户端 最后就是完成go端的grpc请求代码，每次请求都创建一个grpc的连接，请求完毕defer断开：\nfunc GCN_request() (map[string]float32, error) { conn, err := grpc.Dial(\"localhost:9999\", grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())) if err != nil { // Failed to connect to gcnserver(py) by grpc return nil, err } defer conn.Close() client := pb.NewGCNServiceClient(conn) // 创建一个实例的图数据 G_example := \u0026pb.GraphData{ Nodes: []*pb.Node{ {Id: \"node1\", Features: []float32{0.1, 0.2, 0.3}}, {Id: \"node2\", Features: []float32{0.4, 0.5, 0.6}}, }, Edges: []*pb.Edge{ {SourceId: \"node1\", TargetId: \"node2\"}, }, } // 发送请求并接收响应 result, err := client.ProcessGraph(context.Background(), G_example) if err != nil { // Error calling ProcessGraph return nil, err } return result.NodeScores, err } 最后的最后别忘了创建一个路由调用这个方法。\npython端工作 py同样安装grpc相关库\npip install grpcio pip install grpcio-tools 生成grpc文件 终端cd到proto文件目录下，执行：\npython -m grpc_tools.protoc -I ./ --python_out=./ --grpc_python_out=. your-file.proto py的服务端代码grpc相关的代码较为简洁，重点在于数据处理。将其服务端口和grpc客户端的请求端口保持一致。 部分代码取自官方示例。\nimport grpc from concurrent import futures from proto import gcn_pb2_grpc, gcn_pb2 class GCNServicer(gcn_pb2_grpc.GCNServiceServicer): def ProcessGraph(self, request, context): # Process graph data using GCN and return result # example: return gcn_pb2.GCNResult(node_scores={\"node1\": 0.5, \"node2\": 0.8}) def server(): server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)) gcn_pb2_grpc.add_GCNServiceServicer_to_server(GCNServicer(), server) server.add_insecure_port('[::]:9999') server.start() print('gRPC 服务端已开启,端口为9999...') server.wait_for_termination() if __name__ == '__main__': server() 启动 做好了以上工作就大功告成了，启动两个服务即可\ngo run main.go\npython server.py\n然后访问定义的路由地址，如下显示，nice~",

    "content": "前言 本贴将之前没有连接数据库的抽卡模拟器全部完善，最终已经放在了Github上\n用的mysql构建的数据库，导出sql文件，用SQlite3再读一遍，生成一个db文件，创建了四个表\n表 属性 卡池表 序号，卡池名，up角色 卡牌表 卡牌序号，卡牌名，卡牌星级，卡牌种类 卡池\u0026卡牌表 序号，卡池名，卡牌名 抽卡记录表 记录序号，卡池名，卡牌名 简单易用就好，其实后两个表应该用卡池和卡牌表的主键(序号)来做外码的，但查询语句多写一段有点麻烦，就不绕弯子，直接用名字查了。\n预览 功能实现\n单抽+十连的结果图片显示 十连保底出现SR 重做界面，删除无用的登陆界面 可以抽取马娘池，也可以抽取支援卡池子 对抽卡结果的统计 可以自主选择卡池 选择不同卡池出现不同的标志性图片 显示公告 建立抽卡模拟器的数据库，建立表：卡池表，卡牌表，卡池\u0026卡牌表，抽取结果表 连接数据库 抽卡后输出抽卡日志 说明 抽卡逻辑为：\n先得到本次抽卡卡的稀有度 在数据库中查询该稀有度的所有卡牌，随机返回一张 十连保底，但up的概率并未添加 对于日志中的None，表示的是卡名称查询不到。这是因为卡牌数据库构建的不完备，数据太少，有的品质的卡没有具体写入，修改data文件夹中的数据可以完善。data文件夹就是数据库中构建的三个表，而第四个表–抽卡记录表在程序运行后会以txt格式输出到根目录。\n具体修改 为了简明，我把数据库相关的函数写在了conn2sql.py文件中，其中包含数据库的创建，添加元素，查找卡牌以及将数据库的某表输出为txt 源码：\nimport sqlite3 import random # 创建数据库 def create_database_from_sql(sql_file, db_name): with open(sql_file, 'r') as file: sql_statements = file.read() conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.executescript(sql_statements) conn.commit() conn.close() # 数据写入数据库 #添加卡池信息 def insert_cardpool(text_file, db_name): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() with open(text_file, 'r') as file: lines = file.readlines() for line in lines: pool_no, pool_name,pool_up = line.strip().split(\",\") cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO card_pool (pool_no,pool_name,pool_up) VALUES (?,?,?)\", (pool_no, pool_name,pool_up)) conn.commit() conn.close() #添加卡牌信息 def insert_card(text_file, db_name): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() with open(text_file, 'r') as file: lines = file.readlines() for line in lines: card_no, card_name,card_kind,card_star= line.strip().split(\",\") cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO card (card_no, card_name,card_kind,card_star) VALUES (?,?,?,?)\", (card_no, card_name,card_kind,card_star)) conn.commit() conn.close() #添加卡池和卡牌信息 def insert_pool_card(text_file, db_name): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() with open(text_file, 'r') as file: lines = file.readlines() for line in lines: pool_name,card_name=line.strip().split(\",\") cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO poolcard (pool_name, card_name) VALUES (?,?)\", (pool_name,card_name)) conn.commit() conn.close() # 添加抽卡记录 def insert_draw_log(db_name,pool_name,card_name): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO draw_log (pool_name,card_name) VALUES (?,?)\", (pool_name,card_name)) conn.commit() conn.close() #返回卡牌名 def get_cardname(pool_name, star, db_name): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(\"SELECT card_name FROM poolcard WHERE pool_name = ?\", (pool_name,)) pool_cards = cursor.fetchall() pool_cards = [card[0] for card in pool_cards] matching_star_cards = [card for card in pool_cards if get_card_star(card, conn) == star] if matching_star_cards: random_card = random.choice(matching_star_cards) else: random_card = None conn.close() return random_card def get_card_star(card_name, conn): cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(\"SELECT card_star FROM card WHERE card_name = ?\", (card_name,)) result = cursor.fetchone() if result: return result[0] else: return None #将数据库的表输出为txt def export_table_to_txt(table_name, db_name, txt_file): conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name) cursor = conn.cursor() cursor.execute(f\"SELECT * FROM {table_name}\") table_data = cursor.fetchall() conn.close() #写入文件 with open(txt_file, 'w') as file: for row in table_data: row_str = \"\\t\".join(str(value) for value in row) file.write(row_str + \"\\n\") 在启动器/主文件中引用即可。\n除此之外，还有修改原先的start.py文件的部分内容。 为了使得抽卡记录每次都要存入数据库中，抽卡的单抽和十连函数要略加修改。 具体为\n先添加控件信息的读取 poolname=self.cardpool_Box.currentText()#卡池名 db_name = \"card_database.db\"#db文件名 再添加使用数据库查询的函数，使得每次抽卡获得具体的卡牌名 #得到抽卡结果 cardname=conn2sql.get_cardname(pool_name=poolname,star=star,db_name=db_name) conn2sql.insert_draw_log(db_name,poolname,cardname) #存入抽卡记录的数据库 最后添加抽卡日志的输出 #输出日志文件 table_name=\"draw_log\" txt_file=\"draw_log.txt\" conn2sql.export_table_to_txt(table_name,db_name,txt_file) #抽卡记录表导出为txt 对主文件中的四个抽卡函数(one,one2,ten,ten2)均做类似操作即完成了数据库的连接。\n公告内容可有可无，就是一个信息弹窗。\n注意数据库不要重复创建，开始先判空。\n最后 放在了 \u003cu\u003egithub \u003c/u\u003e上，觉得有用可以Star☆ ，hh 本以为简单搞完的，结果还是搞到了半夜T^T",

The room features state-of-the-art organizational solutions, such as “that chair with all the stuff” and “the corner where important things go.”\nVisitors are kindly requested to not disturb the delicate ecosystem of nautical instruments, half-written logbooks, and at least seven different types of tea sets – all carefully arranged in what the captain calls his “systematic randomness.”",

The mess hall doubles as a debate chamber where heated arguments about the best way to predict weather by reading tea leaves can last for days. The walls are decorated with “accurate” maps drawn by our navigator, complete with illustrations of sea serpents and mysterious islands that somehow move location between each voyage. Our ship’s cat, Admiral Whiskers, holds court from atop the highest shelf, judging everyone’s sea shanty performances with characteristic feline disdain.\nDown in the sleeping quarters, you’ll find an impressive collection of lucky charms, ranging from traditional rabbit’s feet to allegedly enchanted ship’s biscuits that are now too petrified to eat. Each bunk is personalized with trinkets from a hundred ports, though no one can quite explain how we acquired the stuffed dodo bird that watches over the entrance. The night watch maintains a running tally of mysterious lights seen over the water, though there’s strong suspicion that half of these sightings coincide suspiciously with nights when the rum rations were doubled.",
